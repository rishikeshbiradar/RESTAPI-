Explore what happens below the surface, and learn how to write better code. This course provides a deep dive into the world wide web, and the underlying structures you need to understand to build robust applications and websites that are efficient and easy to maintain. Learn how HTML documents provide the foundation for CSS and JavaScript, and see how to layer presentation and interactions on top. Learn how different code editors and browsers interact with web content, enabling editing, programming, and display. Discover why accessibility is so important to keeping the web open and available to all users, and what workflow works best for web programming.

In this course, Morten Rand-Hendriksen shows the benefits of taking this approach, and how simple it is to do so. As Morten explains, all that’s needed is a basic understanding of why these elements are so important, how they work, and how good coding practices and modern web standards can get you there with little extra work. He tackles accessibility from all sides, starting with the origins of some of the most common accessibility issues and how to address them, then covers key topics like accessible design, hiding and showing visual content, handling graphics and media, and the semantic elements that can help make your designs more accessible."
